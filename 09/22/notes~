Writing Functions

	function headers
		<return type> <name> (<parameters>)

	You must declare a function before you use it. This can be done in a few ways:

		1) Write the entire function at the top of your code, making sure to keep the order correct.

		2) Write the function headers at the top of your code, and then provide the full definition later.

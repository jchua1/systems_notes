More Pointer Fun

	Pointer arithmetic
		Declaring a pointer as a specific type allows you to add and subtract to the pointer by the size of its associated type.

			int *ip;
			long *lp;
			ip++;  will add 4 to ip
			lp++;  will add 8 to lp
	
		Pointer arithmetic only works with + and - of integers.

	Array variables are immutable pointers.
	Address and value of array variables are the same.
	
	0x means value following it is hexadecimal.

	De-reference

		* is also used as the de-reference operator
			It accesses the value at the memory location stored in a pointer

				int i = 5;
				int *ip = &i;
				*ip++;  this will set i to 6

the only thing that has higher priority than de-reference is increment/decrement

darr[2] <==> *(darr+2) OR *(dp+2)
2[darr] <==> *(2+darr)

[] in c: ADD AND DE-REFERENCE

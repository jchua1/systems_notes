Aim: Sharing is caring!

Do Now: Write a simple c program that creates a child process and have the parent wait for the child to exit. Create a primitive variable in the parent before forking, then modify that variable in the chidl and print it out in both the child and the parent.

Shared Memory - <sys/shm.h>, <sys/ipc.h>, <sys/types.h>

	A segment of heap memory that can be accessed by multiple processes.
	
	Shared memory is accessed via some key that is known by any process that needs to access it.
	
	Shared memory does not get released when a program exits.
	
	5 Shared memory operations:
	
		Create the segment (happens once)
		Access the segment (happens once per process)
		Attach the segment to a variable once (once per process)
		Detach the segment from a variable (once per process)
		Remove the segment (happens once)
		
	shmget
		Create or access a shared memory segment.
		
		Returns a shared memory descriptor (similar idea to a file descriptor), or -1 if it fails.
		
		shmget( key, size, flags )
		
			key
				Unique integer identifier for the shared memory segment (like a file name).
				
			size
				How much memory to request
				
			flags
				Includes permissions for the segment.
				
				Combine with bitwise or
				
				IPC_CREAT: Create the segment
				
								If segment is new, will set value to all 0s
								
				IPC_EXCL: Fail if the segment already exists and IPC_CREAT is on
				
			example
				int sd;
				sd = shmget( 24601, 1024, IPC_CREAT | 0664 )
				
	shmat 
		Attach a shared memory segment to a variable.
		
		Returns a pointer to the segment, or -1 (errno).
		
		shmat( descriptor, address, flags )
		
			descriptor
				The return value of shmget
				
			address
				If 0, the OS will provide the appropriate address
				
			flags
				Usually 0, there is one useful flag
				
				SHM_RDONLY: makes the memory read only

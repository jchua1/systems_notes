Aim: Where do compsci priests live? - In directories!

Directories

	A *nix directory is a file containing the names of the files within the directory along with basic information like file type.
	
	Moving files into/out of a directory means changing the directory file, not actually moving any data.
	
opendir - <dirent.h>

	Open a directory file
	
	This will not change the cwd, it only allows your program to read the contents of the directory file
	
	opendir( <PATH> );
	
	Returns a pointer to a directory stream (DIR *)
	
closedir - <dirent.h>

	Closes the directory stream and frees the pointer associated with it.
	
	closedir( <DIRECTORY STREAM> );
	
readdir - <dirent.h>

	readdir( <DIRECTORY STREAM> )
	
	Returns a pointer to the next entry in a directory stream, or NULL if all entries have already been returned.
	
	struct dirent - <sys/types.h>
	
		Directory struct that contains the information stored in a directory file.
		
		Some of the data members
		
			d_name: Name of a file
			d_type: File type as an int

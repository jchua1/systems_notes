Aim: Redirection; how does it ... SQUIRREL

File Redirection

	 Changing the usual input/output behavior of a program
	 
	 Command line redirection
	 	>
	 		Redirects stdout to a file
	 		
	 		Overwrites the contents of the file
	 		
	 		<COMMAND> > <FILE>
	 		
	 		ls > file_list
	 	
	 	>>
	 		Redirects stdout to a file by appending
	 		
	 	2>
	 		Redirects stdrr in a file
	 		
	 		Overwrites the file (2>> appends)
	 		
	 	%>
	 		Redirects stdout and stderr
	 		
	 	<
	 		Redirects stdin from a file
	 		
	 	| (pipe)
	 		Redirect stdout from one command to stdin of the next
	 		
	 		ls | wc
	 		
Redirection in c programs

	dup2 - <unistd.h>
		
		dup2( fd1, fd2 )
		
			Duplicates the behavior for fd1 at fd2
		
			Redirectrs fd2 to fd1
			
			You will lose any reference to the original fd2, that file is closed.
			
	dup - <unistd.h>
	
		Duplicates an existing entry in the file table.
		
		Returns a new file descriptor for the duplicate entry.
		
		dup( fd )
			returns the new file descriptor

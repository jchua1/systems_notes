More Shared Memory

	shmdt
	
		Detach a variable from a shared memory segment.
		
		Returns 0 upon success of -1 upon failure.
		
		shmdt( pointer )
		
			pointer
				The address used to access the segment
				
		example
			shmdt( p );
			
	shmctl
	
		Perform operations on the shared memory segment
		
		Each shared memory segment has metadata that can be stored in a struct (struct shmid_ds)
		
		Some of that data stored: last access, size, pid of creator, pid of last modification
		
		shmctl( descriptor, command, buffer )
		
			descriptor
				Return value of shmget
				
			commands:
				IPC_RMID: Remove a shared memory segment
				
				IPC_STAT: populate the buffer (struct shmid_ds) with information
				
				IPC_SET: set some of the information for the segment to the info in buffer
				
	ftok - <sys/ipc.h>
	
		Generate a key useful for IPC functions
		
		ftok( path, x )
		
			path
				A path to some file, the file must be accessible by the program.
				
			x
				An int used to generate the key
				
			The same path and x will always generate the same key
			
		sd = shmget(ftok("dir/file", 12), 1024, IPC_CREAT | 0664);

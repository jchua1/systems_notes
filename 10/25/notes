DO NOT SUBMIT EXECUTABLE FILES

INCLUDE A MAKEFILE FOR EVERY ASSIGNMENT

DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CALL RUN IN MAKE



Aim: Read your writes!

Do Now: Write a c program that creates a new file. Give the file read & write permissions to each permission area.

Run ls -l to check the permissions.

When you create a file, there are a set of permissions that are automatically shut off by the system. (File Permission Mask)

umask - <sys/stat.h>

	Set the file creation permission mask
	
	By default, created files are not given the exact permissions provided in the mode argument to open. Some permissions are automatically shut off.
	
	Umask is applied by using bitwise negation on the mask, then bitwide and-ing it to the mode
	
		new_permissions = ~mask & mode
		
					0		2		2
		mask 	  000	  010	  010
		
		~mask	  111   101   101
		mode    110   110   110
		&		  110   110   100
		
read - <unistd.h>
	Read in data from a file
	
	read( <FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <BUFFER>, <AMOUNT> )
	
	read( fd, buff, n )
	
	Read n bytes from the fd's file and put that data into buff
	
	Returns the number of bytes actually read. Returns -1 and sets errno if unsuccessful.
	
	BUFFER must be a pointer.
	
write - <unistd.h>
	Write data to a file
	
	write( <FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <BUFFER>, <AMOUNT> )
	
	write( fd, buff, n )
	
	Write n bytes from buff into fd's file
	
	Returns the number of bytes actually written. Returns -1 and sets errno if unsuccessful.
	
	BUFFER must be a pointer.

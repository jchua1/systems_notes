Aim: Opening up a world of possibilities

Do Now: In your table pairs, look at your computer number and mod it by 2. Then look up the following functions and describe them to your buddy:
	
	0) open/close
	1) read/write
	
open - <fcntl.h>
	Add a file to the file table and returns its file descriptor
	
	If open fails, -1 is returned, extra error information can be found in errno.
	
		errno is an int variable that can be found in <errno.h>, using strerror in (string.h) on errno will return a string description of the error
		
	open( <PATH>, <FLAGS>, <MODE> )
	
	mode
		Only used when creating a file. Set the new file's permissions using a 3 digit octal #
		
		Octal #s have a leading 0
			0644, 0777, ...
			
			
	flags
		Determine what you plan to do with the file.
		
		Use the following constants:
			O_RDONLY
			O_WRONLY
			O_RDWR
			O_APPEND
			O_TRUNC
			O_CREAT
			O_EXCL: when combined with O_CREAT, will return an error if the file exists
			
		Each flag is a number, to combine flags we use bitwise or
		
			O_WRONLY = 1			 00000001
			O_APPEND = 8          00001000
			O_WRONLY | O_APPEND = 00001001
			
close - <unistd.h>
	Remove a file from the file table.
	
	Returns 0 if successful. Returns -1 and sets errno if unsuccessful.

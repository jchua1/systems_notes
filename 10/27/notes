Aim: Seek and ye shall find

Do Now: Prepare for Demo!

If you have a pointer, you have to malloc

lseek - <unistd.h>

	Set the current position in an open file
	
	lseek( <FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <OFFSET>, <WHENCE> )
	
	offset
		Number of bytes to move the position by.
		Can be negative.
		
	whence
		Where to measure the offset from
		
		SEEK_SET
			offset is evaluated from the beginning of the file
			
		SEEK_CUR
			offset is relative to the current position in the file
			
		SEEK_END
			offset is evaluated from the end of the file
			
	returns the number of bytes the current position is from the beginning of the file, or -1 (errno)

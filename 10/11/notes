Do Now: What's wrong with this function?

struct node * insert_front( struct node * n, int i ) {
	
	struct node new;

	new.i = i;
	new.next = n;

	return &new;
}

^ Does not dynamically allocate memory. Static memory might disappear.

Typedef
	Provide a new name for an existing data type.

	typedef <real type> <new name>;

	ex:
		typedef unsigned long size_t;
		size_t x = 139; //x is really an unsigned long

	typedef struct foo { int a; char x; } bar;
		Here, bar is a typedef for struct { int a; char x; }

		bar s;

gdb (GNU Debugger)

	Allows you to get detailed information about a program while it is running.

	gcc -g <file name>
	gdb a.out
	
	run: runs the program
	list: prints code
	backtrace: shows you the stack
	break <line number>: runs program until specified line number
	print <variable name>: prints value of variable
	continue: continues running code after reaching breakpoint
	quit: exits gdb
	
valgrind

You invoke a variable in a makefile by putting it in parentheses and putting a dollar sign in front.

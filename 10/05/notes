Aim: If these files won't behave, we'll have to separate them!

- ? -> if what is before question mark is true, return thing before colon, return thing after otherwise
- strcopy source to terminating null
- gcc is designed to create a SINGLE executable file (different from javac)
- gcc dwstring.c testdw.c -> combines the 2 files

Aim: File this under useful information.

Do Now: What are the different kinds of file permissions?

File Permissions
	3 types of permissions
		read, write, execute (r, w, x)
		
	Permissions can be represented as 3-digit binary #s, or 1-digit octal #s
	
		100 <==> 4 => read only
		111 <==> 7 => read, write, execute
		
	There are 3 permission "areas"
		user, group, others
		
		each area can have its own permissions:
		
		644 => user: read + write, group: read, other: read
		
		deleting a file uses permissions of the directory
		changing into a directory = executing a directory
		using ls in a directory = reading a directory
		
File Table
	A list of all files used by a program while it is running.
	
	Contains basic information like the file's location and size.
	
	The file table has a limited size, which is a power of 2 and commonly 256. getdtablesize() will return this value.
	
	Each file is given an integer index, starting at 0, this is referred to as the file descriptor.
	
	There are 3 files always open in the table:
		0 or STDIN_FILENO: stdin
		1 or STDOUT_FILENO: stdout
		2 or STDERR_FILENO: stderr

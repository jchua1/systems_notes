Aim: malloc & free: The dynamic duo!

Separate compilation

	You can combine multiple c files into a c program by including them all in one gcc command.
		ex
			gcc test.c string.c foo.c woohoo.c

	You cannot have duplicate function or global variable names across these files.

gcc -c

	Generate a compiled "object", or .o file

	Does not create a fully functional program, but it is compiled code.

.o files can be linked together with .c files through gcc.



malloc, free, calloc, and realloc deal with allocating dynamic memory when the program is run.

malloc(int x)
	Allocates x bytes of memory ( from the heap)

calloc(int n, int x)
	Allocates n * x bytes of memory
	Ensures that each bit is set to 0

realloc(void *p, int x)
	Changes the amount of memory allocated to a given block
	p must be a pointer to the beginning of an allocated block of memory, but it does not have to be the original pointer

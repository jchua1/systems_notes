		accept (<socket descriptor>, <socket address>, <address length>)
		
			socket descriptor: return value of socket
			
			address: pointer to a struct sockaddr
						Will contain the correct address information after the connection is made
						
			length: pointer to a 
			
	connect (client only) <sys/socket.h> <sys/types.h>
	
		Connect to another program over a socket.

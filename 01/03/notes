Network Layer
	Transmission of data between two separate networks
	
	Is not concerned with whether or not data was sent successfully (connectionless).
	
	Major features of this layer are addressing, routing and packet forwarding.
	
	IP (internet protocol) addresses
	
		IPv4: 4 byte address
			[0-255] . [0-255] . [0-255] . [0-255]
			
		Routing is made easier by having IP addresses distributed in blocks.

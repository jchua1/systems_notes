Aim: Cisco in an hour VI: The Undiscovered Country

Transport Layer
	Computer to computer connection over a network
	
	Unconcerned with the individual hops of layer 3 traffic
	
	Each destination address had multiple ports
	
		65,535 ports
		
		Each port corresponds to a particular service.
		
		ports < 1024 are well know, reserved ports
		
		Regulated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
		
		TCP
			Transmission Control Protocol
			
			Reliable connection
			
			Guarantees delivery of data
			
			Data is considered a continuous stream that arrives in the order it is sent (which may not be true in the network layer)
			
			Connections are established using a 3-way handshake
			
				Server "binds" to a port and waits
				1. Client sends a SYN message to the server
				2. Server sends the client a SYN_ACK message
				3. Client sends an ACK message to the server
				
		UDP
			User Datagram Protocol
			
			Does not require an explicit connection
			
			Data is sent as discrete datagrams with a set size (as opposed to a continuous stream)
			
			Datagrams may be dropped or received out of order.
			
			Assumes that any kind of error checking is handled at a later level.

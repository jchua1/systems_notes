Aim: What goes Up really should come down.

Do Now: Write a semaphore control program like the one developed in class yesterday. It should be able to:

				Create a semaphore and set an initial value
				View the current value
				Remove the semaphore
				
			The program behavior should be determined by a command line argument.

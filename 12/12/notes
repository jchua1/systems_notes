Aim: Ceci n'est pas une pipe

Pipe
	A conduit between 2 separate processes on the same computer.
	
	Pipes have 2 ends, a read end and a write end.
	
	Pipes are unidirectional (a single pipe must be either read or write only in a process).
	
	Pipes act just like files.
	
	You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write.
	
	Unnamed pipes have no external identification.
	
	pipe - <unistd.h>
		Create an unnamed pipe.
		
		Returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not.
		
		Opens both ends of the pipe as files.
		
		pipe(int descriptors[2])
		
			descriptors
				Array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe.

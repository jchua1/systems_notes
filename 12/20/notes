Aim: Cisco in an hour

Do Now: What is needed in order for 2 computers to communicate with each other?

- Physical Connection
- Identification
- Protocol/common language/common packaging
- Routing information
- Security
- Data validation
- User experience

OSI 7-Layer Model
	Used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connection.
	
	The top layer is the most concrete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code).
	
	The Layers:
		1. Physical
		2. Data Link
		3. Network
		4. Transport
		5. Session
		6. Presentation
		7. Application
		
	If you are working on a particular layer, you should not have to think too much about the other layers.
	
Physical Layer
	How computers are physically connected
	
	Things like electrons running across wires, radio signals pulsing through the air...
	
	A brief history of wired connections
	
		Thicknet
			A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, "vampire taps" go into the cable and leech the data out.
			
		Thinnet
			A single Coaxial cable runs throughout the network, T-Junctions used to splice connections.
			
		In Thicknet and Thinnet, all data is sent to all computers.
		
		Each computer added increases the power drain on the entire system, degrading service.

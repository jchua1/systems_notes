OSI 7-Layer Model
	Used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connection.
	
	The top layer is the most concrete, with each subsequent layer becoming more abstract (relying less on the physical connections and more on code).
	
	The Layers:
		1. Physical
		2. Data Link
		3. Network
		4. Transport
		5. Session
		6. Presentation
		7. Application

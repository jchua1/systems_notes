Physical Layer

	Token Ring
	
		Each computer is connected in a ring to each other.
		
		Only one computer has command of network resources at a time. This is called "having the token".
		
		The network sends a "token" throughout the ring, which contains the identity of the computer allowed to use the network. All other computers must wait to use the network.
		
		No possibility of collisions.
		
	Ethernet
		
		Multiple computers connect to a single hub or switch.
		
		[Computer A] -   - [Computer B]
						 |   |
						 |   |
				   [Hub/Switch]
						 |   |
						 |   |
		[Computer D] -   - [Computer C]
		
		Hub
			Broadcasts the data to all the computer
			
		Switch
			Sends data to a specific computer
			
		The more computers you add to an ethernet network the greater the chance of collisions

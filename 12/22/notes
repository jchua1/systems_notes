Data Link Layer

	Point-to-point transmission between devices on the same local network.
	
	Ethernet Connections:
		Each device is given a unique 6-Byte MAC (Media Access Control) address, this is set on each network card when it is made.
		
		Data is packaged into frames
		
			Ethernet Frame:
				<prefix><dest><source><...><data><checksum>
				8B       6B      6B     6B 46-1500B   4B
				
				prefix: 10101010 x7 + 10101011
				
				destination/source: MAC addresses
				
				...: Information about frame type
				
				checksum: to ensure data integrity
				
			MTU
				Maximum Transmission Unit
				
				1500 Bytes for ethernet
